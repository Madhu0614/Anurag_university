        <h2>About the Conference</h2>
        <p>
            The International Conference on Renewable Energy, Artificial Intelligence, and Sustainable Transportation serves as a dynamic platform that brings together leading researchers, scientists, engineers, and industry professionals from across the globe. The conference aims to foster knowledge exchange and promote collaboration on the latest innovations and trends shaping the future of clean energy, intelligent systems, and sustainable transport solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the face of global challenges such as climate change and resource depletion, renewable energy sources are essential to building a sustainable future. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how energy systems are managed, improving efficiency, predictive maintenance, and decision-making in energy grids and smart technologies. With AI-driven insights, advancements in renewable energy—from solar and wind to hydropower—can be optimized, addressing supply-demand challenges, and lowering emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conference will also focus on sustainable transportation solutions, exploring electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving technologies, and smart city infrastructures. It delves into how AI algorithms enhance EV performance, optimize charging infrastructure, and improve traffic management systems, contributing to greener cities.
        </p>
        <p>
            By bringing together experts in these transformative fields, the conference aspires to foster interdisciplinary discussions, accelerate the development of innovative technologies, and build partnerships that will drive progress in renewable energy, AI, and sustainable transportation. It will be a pivotal event in shaping future research directions and policy-making efforts toward a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable world.
