      <h2 id="about-conf-title">About the Conference</h2>
      <p>
        The International Conference on Renewable Energy, Artificial
        Intelligence, and Sustainable Transportation serves as a dynamic
        platform that brings together leading researchers, scientists,
        engineers, and industry professionals from across the globe. The
        conference aims to foster knowledge exchange and promote collaboration
        on the latest innovations and trends shaping the future of clean
        energy, intelligent systems, and sustainable transport solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of global challenges such as climate change and resource
        depletion, renewable energy sources are essential to building a
        sustainable future. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is
        revolutionizing how energy systems are managed, improving efficiency,
        predictive maintenance, and decision-making in energy grids and smart
        technologies. With AI-driven insights, advancements in renewable
        energy—from solar and wind to hydropower—can be optimized, addressing
        supply-demand challenges, and lowering emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conference will also focus on sustainable transportation solutions,
        exploring electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving technologies,
        and smart city infrastructures. It delves into how AI algorithms
        enhance EV performance, optimize charging infrastructure, and improve
        traffic management systems, contributing to greener cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        By bringing together experts in these transformative fields, the
        conference aspires to foster interdisciplinary discussions, accelerate
        the development of innovative technologies, and build partnerships
        that will drive progress in renewable energy, AI, and sustainable
        transportation. It will be a pivotal event in shaping future research
        directions and policy-making efforts toward a cleaner, smarter, and
        more sustainable world.
